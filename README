Proto-derivat 
-------------

A central repository of files (the proto repository). 
Collections of files in the repository may be subscribed to (as derivats). 
Local files are only changed when requested. 
Differences between the local files and the repository files may be viewed. 

* derive
List all local derivats. 

* derive fetch
For each derivat fetch proto files that are not yet installed. 

* derive diff
For each derivat display a 'diff' of all derivat files against the proto files in repository. 

* derive apply
For each derivat overwrite the derivat files with files from repository. 

* derive  «derivat» diff
Display a 'diff' of all derivat files against the proto files in repository. 

* derive  «derivat» fetch
Fetch derivat files that are not yet installed. 

* derive  «derivat» apply
Overwrite derivat files with proto files from repository. 

* derive «derivat» init «proto-repository» [apply]
Import a collection of files (the derivat) from the proto-repository.
This is a tree of files that are added to the top of the local git repository.
If apply is not given only shows what would be done.
The current directory must contain a directory '.git'.
Files that already exists locally are ignored.
Files that do not exist locally are fetched from the derivat repository.
«proto-repository» is an absolute PATH.
Env[ PROTOREPO ] = basepath to add to proto-repository path. 

FILES 
-----

.derivats/«derivatname» 
Each derivat has its own file. The file contains 1. repository-path 2. a list of paths. 

«repo» 
«path» 

«repo»/«derivat-definition»
«path1» 
.. 
«pathN» 

REPOSITORY 
----------

A proto-repository must contain a ".proto-repository" file that contains a name and/or a short description of this proto repository. A recommendation is that it also is version controlled.
