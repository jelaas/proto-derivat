Proto-derivat 
-------------

A central repository of files (the proto repository). 
Collections of files in the repository may be subscribed to (as prototypes). 
Local files are only changed when requested. 
Differences between the local files and the repository files may be viewed. 

* proto
List all local prototypes. 

* proto fetch
For each prototype fetch proto files that are not yet installed. 

* proto diff
For each prototype display a 'diff' of all prototype files against the proto files in repository. 

* proto apply
For each prototype overwrite the prototype files with files from repository. 

* proto  «prototype» diff
Display a 'diff' of all prototype files against the proto files in repository. 

* proto  «prototype» fetch
Fetch prototype files that are not yet installed. 

* proto  «prototype» apply
Overwrite prototype files with proto files from repository. 

* proto «prototype» init «proto-repository» [apply]
Import a collection of files (the prototype) from the proto-repository.
This is a tree of files that are added to the top of the local git repository.
If apply is not given only shows what would be done.
The current directory must contain a directory '.git'.
Files that already exists locally are ignored.
Files that do not exist locally are fetched from the prototype repository.
«proto-repository» is an absolute PATH.
Env[ PROTOREPO ] = basepath to add to proto-repository path. 

FILES 
-----

.derivats/«prototypename» 
Each prototype has its own file. The file contains 1. repository-path 2. a list of paths. 

«repo» 
«path» 

«repo»/«prototype-definition»
«path1» 
.. 
«pathN» 

REPOSITORY 
----------

A proto-repository must contain a ".proto-repository" file that contains a name and/or a short description of this proto repository. A recommendation is that it also is version controlled.

TEMPLATES
---------

Basic support for making templates is implemented.
If your prototype includes the file 'X', you make a companion file 'X.sed'.
When proto applies the file 'X' it will use each line of 'X.sed' as input to "sed -i".

Example:
File t.txt:
configoption=OPT1

File t.txt.sed:
s/OPT1/actualconfigtext/

When applying the prototype 't.txt' will first be copied verbatim.
Then "sed -i 's/OPT1/actualconfigtext/' t.txt" will be run.
